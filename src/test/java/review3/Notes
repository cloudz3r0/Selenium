waits in selenium:
to overcome synchronization issues
Sleep can take longer even after the element is able to be used.
Thread.sleep is good but we dont know the exact time until the element is present or found.
So we use waits to get the exact times.


Implicit wait: implicit wait is wait till element is found.
If the element is not found in the duration of time out
it will return us with exception.
syntax of implicit wait:
driver.manage(0.timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));

Explicit Wait:
Has to be declared for every individual element if needed.
Explicit wait is going to wait until the WebElement fulfills the condition.
As soon as condition is fulfilled it moves on to the next line of code.
If the condition isnt fulfilled(in the duration of timeout) it will give an exception.
WebDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver,Duration.ofSeconds(20));
wait.until(ExpectedConditions."The condition for which you want to wait for"(The webelement)
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("//button[text()='Enabled']"));
