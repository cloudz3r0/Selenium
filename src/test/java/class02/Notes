Locators are used to locate and interact with web elements:
-Name
-Id
-Class
-Linktext
-Partiallinktext
-Tag name
-Path
-Css
Avoid locators that have digits and spaces.
If in case you use a locator with a duplicate value, selenium will find the first one
and interact with it. For example id= first_name;
It will look for an id and first name.

 Linktext:
 The element must be in an "a" tag, a tag is also called anchor tag and it usually
 contains links.
 The element must have text in it. If one of the conditions is not fulfilled you cant
 use the linktext locator.
 Partial Linktext:
 You can use partial text to locate linkTexts.
1.the element must be in "a" tag , a tag is also called anchor tag and it usually contains links
2.the element must have some text
if one of the condition is not fullfiled u cant use the linktext locator

 Webelement commands:
 1.clear()--> clear the text box
 2.getText()--> to copy the text(if there is no text it will return nothing)
 3.get attribute(attribute); get attribute value
 4.value.click(); click whatever you navigated to
 press ctrl+F at the button to search for tag
