initiate instance of webdriver
driver.get("url");  or  driver.navigate.to('Url");
navigate is like searching another thing on the same tab.
Can go backwards or forwards in the tab unlike the get command
Driver.get just opens up the tab to whatever url is mentioned.
get waits for the whole page to load.
