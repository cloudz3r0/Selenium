Implicit wait syntax:
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));
Implicit wait is going to wait until web element is found NOT LOADED, JUST FOUND in DOM.
  If it's not found it will
  return you an exception. If found - will immediately move to the next piece of code.
 It's a global wait:

ones declared in start it's automatically implemented to all the elements that are needed
     to be found;


EXPLICIT WAIT:
     Explicit wait waits for a certain condition to be fulfilled (e.g. is enabled) regarding the element,
     the condition is specified by user.

     Indexes on tables are different. Usually it wont be by index and goes by just order placement.
