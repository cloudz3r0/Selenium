get() vs navigate()
get you cant go back or forward in history
Waits for whole page to load.

navigate you can go back and forward and also refresh
doesnt wait for the whole page to load.

close() vs quit()
Close () —> will close current tab
quit()—> will quit the whole browser
fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see url, tabs, bookmarks
    and fullscreen() will maximize the whole web application
 What is a WebElement?
    anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
    e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

    HTML?
    HyperText Markup Language

    What is DOM?
    DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
    internal view of the webpage.
    Also called as Developer's tools, or Dev tools
    Document --> can be stored any document as pdf, excel
    Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
    Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

     Locator
        is an address or a position of an webelement on the web page
        is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage

        8 Locators:
        - ID
        - Name
        - Tagname
        - xpath
        - linktext
        - partialLinkText
        - CSS Selector
        - ClassName

Why do we need many locators?
        -- some locators might have duplicate values in other nodes
        -- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements

   <button>click me</button>
        a text is always located betweeen >< of the tag (i.e opening and closing of the tag
        the above tag has text

        <a href="g"></a>
        the above tag has no text
